NOTE: These are separate to the whatsapp GC's qs.

* Shouldn't the user's age be part of the MVP, since it's a pretty import thing ethically? You don't seem to be decided on whether or not you're going to include the age rating as part of the MVP or not.
  And also since the age rating is something you display with the film recommendation?
* How do you plan to secure the user's data? What type of encryption algorithm?
* In the search function, how exactly do you plan to prevent children from searching up 
  films beyond their age rating? Or is this not part of the MVP?
* In the earlier slides, you showed multiple designs of the webpage, on a range of different            
  platforms. Does that mean you plan to have mobile compatibility as part of your MVP? 
* For your extension idea of using tensorflow's pre-trained model, have you considered the     ethical and legal considerations of that? Are you allowed to implement that without anything    like copyright issues arising? 
*
