So, the answer to this question lies within the architecture diagram we displayed earlier. (Scroll back to that slide). As we explained earlier, there are two different types of recommendations, one depending on genre and one completely random. For the genre based recommendation, the software will retrieve the genres that the users prefer, which are stored inside the 'user genre preferences' part of the database, as well as the streaming services that the user has, which is stored in the streaming services part of the database. It will then use the JustWatch API to retrieve a selection of films under that genre, and whilst we don't know the ins and outs of how that API works, we think it will give an array of films, in which case we can generate 1 random integers. We will then use that integer as an index to retrieve a film from the array we get off the API. Then, it checks if that film is available on the user's platforms. If it is, then it will get recommended, if not, then the process will restart. This will loop until 3 films have been recommended, whilst checking that the same random integer doesn't get generated twice. For random recommendations, it will be pretty much the same, except of using arrays specific to genre, it should be one giant array with every film that the API has available.
